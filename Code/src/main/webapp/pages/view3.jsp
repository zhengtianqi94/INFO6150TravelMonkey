                    My friends and I pretty much walked everywhere — so easy to do in Boston. You can also rent
                    bikes from the New Balance Hubway Bike-Share System, very accessible with 140+ Hubway stations
                    in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline and Somerville. The cost is $6 per day, $12 for 72 hours, $20
                    for a month unlimited and $85 for the year unlimited, though note you’ll need to dock your bike
                    every 30 minutes to avoid penalties. You can dock and then take it right back out.<br><br>
                    For a few attractions like Harvard and Fenway Park we used the subway, which cost $2.65 for a
                    one-way pay-as-you-go ticket. Here is more information on the local subway system. You can see
                    below the subway map is pretty easy to read as long as you know your starting point, ending
                    point and the direction you’re heading. Even though I’m good at reading subway maps I still use
                    the CityMapper app, which works in many cities and tells you exactly how to get from Point A to
                    Point B, where to exit a train, how to get around a city by bike and on foot (including how many
                    calories you’ll burn), and provides offline maps.<br><br>
                    We researched quite a few hotels, hostels and AirBNBs, and HI Boston Hostel (HI Boston) was a
                    clear winner. Our location was on the edge of Chinatown and the Theater District, walkable to
                    all the major sites and nightlife areas. We paid $50 per person, per night for the 4- and
                    6-bedroom dorms we stayed in, including free Wi-Fi, access to free tours and activities like pub
                    crawls and history walks, and a breakfast featuring toast, jams, cereals, juices, coffees/teas,
                    yogurts, waffles and fruits. There were also numerous common areas for chilling out, playing
                    pool and socializing. Bathrooms were shared but one-person-at-a-time for extra privacy, and each
                    bed had its own light and outlets.<br><br>
                    In Chinatown at Joy Luck Hot Pot I savored a massive Tom Yum soup laced with lobster, beef, duck
                    tongue, pumpkin, broccoli and vermicelli for ~$25. A bit pricier than what I’m used to in NYC
                    where I do a buffet for $18, but still a blast. Note there is no alcohol served here and it’s
                    not BYO.<br><br>
                    Oh, and the duck tongue? If you’re picturing simply a tougher meat, as with beef tongue, the
                    duck tongue tasted like hard cartilage poking my insides. If I went back I’d order the exact
                    same thing sans tongue.<br><br>
                    My friends and I wanted some local seafood, and the locals we spoke to all touted Yankee Lobster
                    Company in Boston’s Seaport District as one of the best for those on a budget. We got whole
                    lobsters with slaw, fries and corn on the cob for $24.99, as well as a lobster roll full of meat
                    ($14.99) and a filling salmon burger ($9.99). This is also where you can get Boston’s famous
                    fried clams.<br><br>
