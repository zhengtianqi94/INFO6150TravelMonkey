                    Food Heaven<br>
                    Food is an obsession for the Chinese and the dazzling array of different dishes you’ll encounter
                    in Běijīng reflects the sheer joy locals take in eating. Dining out is the main social activity;
                    it’s in restaurants that Běijīngers party with friends, romance each other, hold family reunions
                    and do business, and the sheer variety of places to eat here is mind-boggling. Menus will have
                    you salivating over succulent Peking duck, delicious dumplings and chewy noodles, but there’s
                    food from every corner of China (and beyond) to be sampled too. From fiery Sìchuānese to
                    Turkic-inspired Uyghur cuisine, Běijīng's 60,000-plus restaurants cover every base.<br><br>
                    Imperial Delights<br>
                    Few places on earth can match the extraordinary historical panorama on display in Běijīng. There
                    are six Unesco World Heritage Sites in this city alone (just one less than the whole of Egypt).
                    At its heart is the magnificent Forbidden City, a royal palace on a scale like no other. Běijīng
                    is also home to sublime temples that aspire to cosmological perfection, while the city centre is
                    criss-crossed by enchanting hútòng: ancient alleyways that teem with life today, as they did
                    hundreds of years ago. And, to cap it all, the awe-inspiring Great Wall snakes its way across
                    the hills north of town.<br><br>
                    Architectural Ambition<br>
                    It's not just the ancient architecture that wows tourists. Běijīng is also home to some of the
                    world's most innovative modern buildings. The world's leading architects clamber for the chance
                    to make their mark on this global powerhouse, and jaw-dropping structures such as the CCTV
                    Building, Galaxy Soho, the NCPA concert hall and the Olympic Stadium are clear signs that
                    Běijīng is not shy about proclaiming its status as China’s capital. Like the temples and palaces
                    of the ancient past, and the imposing socialist realist monuments of the 1950s, these latest
                    additions are built on a scale that screams, ‘Look at me!’.<br><br>
                    Acrobats & Artists<br>
                    Běijīng isn’t just the political centre of China – it’s the cultural heart of the country too.
                    The nation’s top artists, writers, movie-makers and musicians converge here, making this the
                    place to take the pulse of China’s ever-evolving cultural scene. With top-class museums,
                    galleries galore, and an increasing number of music venues, there’s enough to keep you busy day
                    and night. Běijīng is also the centre for the traditional Chinese performing arts. Whether it’s
                    the mystique of Peking opera, tumbling acrobats or the graceful lines of Chinese classical dance
                    that entrances you, the capital has it and more.<br><br>
