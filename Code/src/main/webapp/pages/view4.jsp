                    Montreal is a city with history. It has a very long and beautiful French past (it was one of the
                    first cities in Canada) making it one of Canada’s most historic places. With countless museums
                    and galleries, the second largest botanical garden in the world, and parks scattered all over
                    the city, there is plenty to keep you busy. In addition, the Old Town harks back to medieval
                    Europe and the French-inspired cuisine and eclectic nightlife (especially the jazz clubs) leave
                    little to dislike about this city. I first came here when I was 18 because it was the closest
                    place to where I lived that allowed me to drink. Subsequent visits as an adult have only made me
                    appreciate the city on a deeper level and it remains one of my favorite in North America. Use
                    this guide to help you plan your next trip to Montreal!<br><br>
                    Hostels start around 15 CAD a night for a dorm room and 65 CAD for a private. With several
                    award-winning hostels, there are a variety of options to choose from based on your budget and
                    expectations. Free WiFi is standard, and all the top hostels in the city include free breakfast.
                    Most are also all in the same area of town, so you don’t need to worry about picking the best
                    location. If you prefer camping to hostels, there are a few options outside the city though they
                    are quite expensive (30 CAD per night or more).<br><br>
                    During the summer months, you can also rent an empty dorm room any one of Montreal’s
                    universities. Prices vary depending on when you book, though expect to pay at least 50 CAD per
                    night. Dorm rooms are technically available all year, though during the semester they are
                    usually occupied.<br><br>
                    Restaurants will average 40 CAD for dinner, including a glass of wine or beer. You can find some
                    cheap eateries for around 13 CAD, as well as plenty of cheap sandwich shops, but if you want a
                    nice meal, you’ll pay for it. If you are going to cook your own food, expect to pay between
                    55-90 CAD per week. Be sure to try Montreal bagels during your visit, and be sure to hit up a
                    deli – the city is known for them!<br><br>
                    Tickets for one trip (including transfer) on the metro and buses are 3.25 CAD. If you purchase
                    ten tickets at once you’ll save 6 CAD. Tourist passes offer unlimited travel on the bus and
                    metro for periods of one day (10 CAD) or three days (18 CAD). Also, check the unlimited evening
                    pass (6 pm-5 am) which is 5 CAD. Weekly passes will set you back about 25.75 CAD.<br><br>
