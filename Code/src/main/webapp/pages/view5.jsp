                    Fashion capital of the world or not, Milan has the kind of understated charm that takes a while
                    to appreciate. This isn’t Italy, first-time visitors say. Smack-bang in the centre of North of
                    the country, this unofficial capital looks towards Europe: banks and office buildings outnumber
                    churches, whilst high-rise towers and fast-paced locals with business to attend to make the city
                    seem closer to Frankfurt than to Florence. True, at first glance it may not look more than an
                    economic and transport hub; but be warned: give it a few days and don’t make for the monumental
                    Stazione Centrale just yet, and you’ll see there’s more to Milan than designer boutiques.<br><br>
                    Milan has something for everyone. World-class shopping and a thriving cultural scene.
                    Bespectacled hipsters strolling side by side Gucci-toting beauties. Designer bars and family-run
                    trattorie, with a pinch of artisan breweries thrown in. Sporting enthusiasts will marvel at San
                    Siro stadium, and opera lovers can head straight to La Scala Theatre. What is true of Milan, is
                    true of its people. The Milanese have a reputation for being unfriendly and obsessed with work.
                    Visit one of Milan’s bars at aperitivo time and you’ll find that their real obsession is having
                    a good time. And after moaning that Milan is not as cool as London or Berlin, by the end of the
                    night they’ll confess there’s nowhere else they’d rather be.<br><br>
                    Catch the metropolitana to begin your Milan exploration in Piazza del Duomo, the city’s beating
                    heart, dominated by the frosted cake silhouette of its namesake cathedral. Construction of the
                    Duomo, in true Italian style, took a mere 500 years. Wander around the inside to see stained
                    glass windows and the mummified corpses of two bishops, and then admire the pink-marble Gothic
                    façade. If it’s a clear day, don’t miss climbing up to the roof for a view stretching all the
                    way to the Alps. This guided tour allows you to skip the lines.<br><br>
                    Head right towards Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, the oldest covered shopping arcade in town,
                    nicknamed il salotto di Milano (Milan’s drawing room). Skip the rip-off cafès and head towards
                    the left until you find the image of a bull on the mosaic floor. A local superstition claims
                    that spinning three times on the bull’s attributes brings good luck.<br><br>
